# Onboarding Checklist

A compact checklist to walk through during your first days on the project.

## Day 0 — Before you start
- [ ] Ensure GitHub access and permissions
- [ ] Provision SSH key and add to GitHub
- [ ] Read `README.md` and `docs/DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md`

## Day 1 — Setup
- [ ] Clone repo and install dependencies
- [ ] Start local Hardhat node (see `docs/setup.md`)
- [ ] Deploy dev contracts and seed local data (if applicable)
- [ ] Run frontend with `npm run dev`
- [ ] Run tests: `cd frontend && npm test`

## Day 2 — Contribute
- [ ] Pick a small issue / cleanup task
- [ ] Write tests for bug fixes or features
- [ ] Open PR and get feedback

## Troubleshooting
- If tests fail, check node version and run `npm ci` to clean install
- Reach out to maintainers for access or guidance
