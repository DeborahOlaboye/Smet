# User Guide: Contract Details

This page lists contract addresses and basic read-only interactions for users.

## Deployed contracts (Sepolia)

## Read-only interactions
- Use Etherscan's `Read Contract` to query things like contract state or recent events.
- For example, check balances or count of total opens.

## Where to find ABIs
- The frontend packages ABIs under `frontend/src/config` (or see the contract artifacts in the `contract` folder).
