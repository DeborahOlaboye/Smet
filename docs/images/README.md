# Images for Documentation

This folder contains screenshots used in frontend docs.

To update screenshots:
1. Capture the app in the browser (recommended size 1200x675)
2. Add the image as `screenshot-<n>.png` in this folder
3. Update references in `frontend/DOCUMENTATION.md` or `frontend/README.md`

PNG or SVG is acceptable. Keep file sizes small for the repo.
