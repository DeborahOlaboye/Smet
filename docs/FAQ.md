# FAQ & Troubleshooting

Q: Tests fail after cloning and installing dependencies
A: Ensure you have Node.js LTS installed; run `npm ci` in the repo root and `cd frontend && npm ci` for a clean install.

Q: Where are contract ABIs and addresses configured?
A: See `frontend/src/config/contracts.ts` and `docs/DEVELOPER_ONBOARDING.md` for local deployment instructions.

Q: How do I reach maintainers?
A: Open an issue and tag the relevant maintainer or use the `developer-onboarding` issue template if you need access.
