# Troubleshooting for Users

## I don't see my wallet in the list
- Ensure you have a supported wallet installed (MetaMask) or use WalletConnect.
- Check browser extensions are enabled and the site is not blocked by adblockers.

## My transaction failed
- Inspect the transaction on Etherscan for revert messages.
- Check you sent enough ETH for gas and the required value for `open()`.

## I got a prize I didn't expect
- Provide tx hash and screenshots in a new issue; maintainers will investigate.

## App shows 'No wallets available'
- Ensure you are browsing from a supported environment or use WalletConnect from mobile.
